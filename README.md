<p>My name is Minh Duc Nguyen. Im a 1st year student studying Bachelor of I.T at RMIT University.<p>
<p>My student number is s3766338 and my email address is s3766338@student.rmit.edu.au <p>
I'm a international student from Vietnam. I've been studying in Australia for 6 years and I enjoy it a lot. My highest education I have done so far is highschool. I can speak two languages:
Vietnamese and English. I can describe myself as a sporty person since I could play soccer, basketball, badminton and more but my favorite one is badminton. My hobbies are nothing too special
only playing badminton twice a week ( used to before Covid-19 ), hanging out with friends and playing games.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<h2>Interest in I.T</h2>
<p> I.T is big major fields with minor fields in it but what dragged me into I.T is the A.I from scientific movies that I have watched before, when I watched it made me say "Wow"
this's actually so cool and I want to do it. With the development of the technology I thought of A.I could be part of the future to help the mankind what we coudldn't handle.
First, I didn't except to do I.T but other course but then after listening to Elon Musk's speeches, everything has changed. His speech inspirated me to believe that technology really
could make our life better ofcourse there will be problems and errors but we could fix it and make it better. I choose to come to RMIT because RMIT is a well-educated university around
the world and it helps me with my future pathway as well. During my time in RMIT, I'm expecting to get useful infomations from the lecturers so I could improve myself, my skills and 
find my true passionate that I've been looking for a long time.<p>

<p> My Ideal Job will be the job that I'd love to work in that field. In my mind right now, I don't know the exact ideal job that I'm looking for but I'd love to work as a web developer for now. The job in the advertisement in Seek seem to the one that fit my expectations the most. It's a company named "Castle Jackson" located in Melbourne CBD so it would be easy to get to work. The income of this full time job is between about $70,000 to $84,999 per annum. This role came through my mind because I found this role is quite interesting and with this role I could develope skills in making websites for the company. Even though this job is going to be difficult but I'd like to learn things on the way to improve my skills. This job appeal to me because it requires a lot of technique that will be helpful for my pathway. With this job I could go oversea to do the project so it would be a good experience <p>



<p> In a company, people required to do their job so is "Castle Jackson" has a certain expectation is us, the programmer. The company expected us to have a minimum 2 years in Web Development experience and a year in Systems adminstration. Have a good level of understand and be able to work effectively in a team also an importation requirement that they have given.Have some SEO or Graphic Design is a good one for people to get into this job but that isn't neccessary so it would be on the job training. Be an independence in problem solving and have a high skill in team management.
  


<p>At the moment I don't have any skills or experiences to do this job I just have learnt Java and C++ so I'm still developing my skills but I'm on my way to reach my goals. It's hard to learn new things just by theory but also need hand on to practice more. To learn new things I'll need to learn a lot from my colleague and ask them to help me if I have any troubles therefore I could keep learning and makes thing better. I could use my communication skills so it shouldn't be a big problem. But the way I prefer to learn is hands on doing things so if I practice more my skills will be improve. With the qualification that they need I'll do more courses to achieve it and do work experiences in others companies to gain more experiences in this specific field.

<p>It's important for the employers to understand their employees so these test were made to test their ability. Those tests have showed me some of the results that I haven't expected. I didn't expect to be an extrovert since I'm kind of a mix between extrovert and introvert so I'll call myself as an ambivert. I've never those tests like this before so it make me know better about myself. I think that those tests were made so people could have a deeper understand about their personalities not only for the job but for their life. So thanks to this test I could see my strength and weakness area and basing on that I could promote my abilities and try to overcome my weakness.



The results of these test is very detailed. Those test could help me find the way to improve myself so I could put my effort into team's work. Everyone single one in my team will have their own personality so those tests that I have taken shouldn't be the matter to how I put my efforts through the work. As a team we need to listen to other's opinions and from that we could learn a lot. Those results are just one factor, others are basing on our ability so it's the most important one. In a team, we need to understand what requirements we need to follow to reach the highest outcome that's the most important one. Everyone test will be different so we could support each others, since my tests came back as I'm a creative person so it's important to have a logical thinking person in a team so we could assist others.


It's very important when picking teammate for a project because they will affect our outcome. So for me I'll find a teammate it takes a lot of factors and understandable between teammate in a group
