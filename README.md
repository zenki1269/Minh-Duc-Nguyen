<h2>My info</h2>
<p>My name is Minh Duc Nguyen. Im a 1st year student studying Bachelor of I.T at RMIT University.<p>
<p>My student number is s3766338 and my email address is s3766338@student.rmit.edu.au <p>
I'm a international student from Vietnam. I've been studying in Australia for 6 years and I enjoy it a lot. My highest education I have done so far is highschool. I can speak two languages:
Vietnamese and English. I can describe myself as a sporty person since I could play soccer, basketball, badminton and more but my favorite one is badminton. My hobbies are nothing too special
only playing badminton twice a week ( used to before Covid-19 ), hanging out with friends and playing games.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<h2>Interest in I.T</h2>
<p> I.T is big major fields with minor fields in it but what dragged me into I.T is the A.I from scientific movies that I have watched before, when I watched it made me say "Wow"
this's actually so cool and I want to do it. With the development of the technology I thought of A.I could be part of the future to help the mankind what we coudldn't handle.
First, I didn't except to do I.T but other course but then after listening to Elon Musk's speeches, everything has changed. His speech inspirated me to believe that technology really
could make our life better ofcourse there will be problems and errors but we could fix it and make it better. I choose to come to RMIT because RMIT is a well-educated university around
the world and it helps me with my future pathway as well. During my time in RMIT, I'm expecting to get useful infomations from the lecturers so I could improve myself, my skills and 
find my true passionate that I've been looking for a long time.<p>
