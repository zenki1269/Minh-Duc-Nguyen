<p>My name is Minh Duc Nguyen. Im a 1st year student studying Bachelor of I.T at RMIT University.<p>
<p>My student number is s3766338 and my email address is s3766338@student.rmit.edu.au <p>
I'm a international student from Vietnam. I've been studying in Australia for 6 years and I enjoy it a lot. My highest education I have done so far is highschool. I can speak two languages:
Vietnamese and English. I can describe myself as a sporty person since I could play soccer, basketball, badminton and more but my favorite one is badminton. My hobbies are nothing too special
only playing badminton twice a week ( used to before Covid-19 ), hanging out with friends and playing games.</p>
