<p>My name is Minh Duc Nguyen. Im a 1st year student studying Bachelor of I.T at RMIT University.
<p>My student number is s3766338 and my email address is s3766338@student.rmit.edu.au. I'm a international student from Vietnam. I've been studying in Australia for 6 years and I enjoy it a lot. My highest education I have done so far is highschool. I can speak two languages:
Vietnamese and English. I can describe myself as a sporty person since I could play soccer, basketball, badminton and more but my favorite one is badminton. My hobbies are nothing too special
only playing badminton twice a week ( used to before Covid-19 ), hanging out with friends and playing games.</p>

<h2>Interest in I.T</h2>
<p> I.T is big major fields with minor fields in it but what dragged me into I.T is the A.I from scientific movies that I have watched before, when I watched it made me say "Wow"
this's actually so cool and I want to do it. With the development of the technology I thought of A.I could be part of the future to help the mankind what we coudldn't handle.
First, I didn't except to do I.T but other course but then after listening to Elon Musk's speeches, everything has changed. His speech inspirated me to believe that technology really
could make our life better ofcourse there will be problems and errors but we could fix it and make it better. I choose to come to RMIT because RMIT is a well-educated university around
the world and it helps me with my future pathway as well. During my time in RMIT, I'm expecting to get useful infomations from the lecturers so I could improve myself, my skills and 
find my true passionate that I've been looking for a long time.

<p> My Ideal Job will be the job that I'd love to work in that field. In my mind right now, I don't know the exact ideal job that I'm looking for but I'd love to work as a web developer for now. The job in the advertisement in Seek seem to the one that fit my expectations the most. It's a company named "Castle Jackson" located in Melbourne CBD so it would be easy to get to work. The income of this full time job is between about $70,000 to $84,999 per annum. This role came through my mind because I found this role is quite interesting and with this role I could develope skills in making websites for the company. Even though this job is going to be difficult but I'd like to learn things on the way to improve my skills. This job appeal to me because it requires a lot of technique that will be helpful for my pathway. With this job I could go oversea to do the project so it would be a good experience.



<p> In a company, people required to do their job so is "Castle Jackson" has a certain expectation is us, the programmer. The company expected us to have a minimum 2 years in Web Development experience and a year in Systems adminstration. Have a good level of understand and be able to work effectively in a team also an importation requirement that they have given.Have some SEO or Graphic Design is a good one for people to get into this job but that isn't neccessary so it would be on the job training. Be an independence in problem solving and have a high skill in team management.
  


<p>At the moment I don't have any skills or experiences to do this job I just have learnt Java and C++ so I'm still developing my skills but I'm on my way to reach my goals. It's hard to learn new things just by theory but also need hand on to practice more. To learn new things I'll need to learn a lot from my colleague and ask them to help me if I have any troubles therefore I could keep learning and makes thing better. I could use my communication skills so it shouldn't be a big problem. But the way I prefer to learn is hands on doing things so if I practice more my skills will be improve. With the qualification that they need I'll do more courses to achieve it and do work experiences in others companies to gain more experiences in this specific field.<p>

<p>It's important for the employers to understand their employees so these test were made to test their ability. Those tests have showed me some of the results that I haven't expected. I didn't expect to be an extrovert since I'm kind of a mix between extrovert and introvert so I'll call myself as an ambivert. I've never those tests like this before so it make me know better about myself. I think that those tests were made so people could have a deeper understand about their personalities not only for the job but for their life. So thanks to this test I could see my strength and weakness area and basing on that I could promote my abilities and try to overcome my weakness. 



<p>The results of these test is very detailed. Those test could help me find the way to improve myself so I could put my effort into team's work. Everyone single one in my team will have their own personality so those tests that I have taken shouldn't be the matter to how I put my efforts through the work. As a team we need to listen to other's opinions and from that we could learn a lot. Those results are just one factor, others are basing on our ability so it's the most important one. In a team, we need to understand what requirements we need to follow to reach the highest outcome that's the most important one. Everyone test will be different so we could support each others, since my tests came back as I'm a creative person so it's important to have a logical thinking person in a team so we could assist others.


<p>It's very important when picking teammate for a project because they will affect our outcome. So for me I'll find a teammate it takes a lot of factors and understandable between teammate in a group. Since I'm more in creative I'd like to find a logical person to work with because they're good with planning and doing the works that I'd be struggling while doing it on my own. People with logical thinking would be very helpful and also I need people to be organised so they'll finish everything before hand not until the day before deadlines. It's hard to find people that we're looking for but I believe that I could find the one that has potential to work with and make the effective outcome.

<h2> Project Ideal <h2>
  <p> I've watched so many fiction movie like Iron Man, Tron and Wall-E and really I must say that I'm pretty impressed by how the A.I function. I want to create a technology where I could use A.I learning and apply it to university. This project is aabout create a A.I project that can detecting students and make sure they aren't cheating during exam because we know that now technology is so advanced now make it easier to cheat with smart watches and more. 

 <p> This application's main target audience that we're looking for to be collaboration with is universities in Australia for now and if it's successful we could open it in worldwide Now people know that A.I is the future and we have applied A.I to many things like vending machine, delivering or they even tried it for Uber. This project will be useful because basing on the statistics there're many students want to cheat during the exams in the university. Unfortunaly most cheated students are international students. This project could bring a big win for the university in Australia and university around the world because it will decrease the number of students cheating using smartphones and smart watches. Making the exams fair are the most important thing that the university is heading to so this application will be helpful.


<p> It's very simple for the university to keep track of their students and make sure everyone taking their exams seriously. Modern technology is part of our modern lifestyle now and people hard to live without it. With this A.I technology we will use facial (eyes) expression so we could track any movement that the students made and read their actions if they try to cheat then A.I will send the data through the camera and save it in the database so administrator could run through the data and process the potential cheaters. Students scared that they will get caught so that's why they will do everything to cheat without getting caught so we have made a data base. This method won't cost us a lot of time only the cost of getting program to required A.I to work so it's quite expensive but doesn't mean university can't handle them. The most unique features of this system is that the university don't need to do anything beside setting up the system and let A.I do their job. A.I is advanced technology so machine learning can do more then we could imagine. We will use DataRobot to solve out the number and make unique profiles since there're many students enrolled in the university. <p>




<p>To build this application we need to apply some softwares to make it comes true.  Everyone know the common programming langagues like : Java, Python, C++ so we'll use Python to create our A.I because Python seem to be the perfect programming language for this with its unparalleled community support and pre-built libraries (like NumPy, Pandas, Pybrain, and SciPy) that help expedite AI development. There're a lot of programmers in the university so it wouldn't be a problem because they could give us a hand to improve if our product isn't what they expected so we'll improve it with casual updates path.


<p> To make the project come true we need those skills above combining with "Datarobot" database with face recognition will push the platform to reach their highest productivity and to achieve the best outcome we could. Datarobot is a perfect platform to store our data so we could track students if they cheat again because they will have profile in the database. We need high understanding level of Python language so we can make it run smoothly and it's the most important requirement <p>
